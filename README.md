# SlideshowEZ

SlideshowEZ is a simple and lightweight slideshow viewer for Windows.

It was created as a practical and more capable replacement for the slideshow feature that existed
in older versions of Windows and was removed in Windows 11, offering a fast and
straightforward way to view image folders without configuration or system changes.
