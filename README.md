SlideshowEZ

Available in: English | [Português](README.pt.md) | [Español](README.es.md)


SlideshowEZ was created to be a simple, fast, and straightforward slideshow viewer,
serving as a lightweight and more capable replacement for the old Windows slideshow
viewer that was removed in Windows 11.

The goal is to allow you to open folders or image files and view your photos
immediately, without complications and without modifying anything on your system.

Also, when you find an image that interests you, just right click an choose "open the folder that contains this image". Or, right click and choose to follow that image in the slideshow.
